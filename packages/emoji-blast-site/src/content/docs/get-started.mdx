title: Get Started
---

`emoji-blast` is a lightweight library that provides ways to blast emojis in a web page.
It can be embedded in virtually any web app.

:::tip
See [`konami-emoji-blast`](./konami-emoji-blast.mdx) for integrations that trigger blasts of emojis from the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code).
If you're trying to add a fun ["easter egg"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)>) to your app, that's all you need.

## Quick Bundler Start

If you're writing JavaScript or TypeScript with a bundler, first install the `emoji-blast` package as a dependency:

```shell
npm i emoji-blast
```

You can then import it in your code to access its `emojiBlast` and `emojiBlasts` functions:

```ts
import { emojiBlast, emojiBlasts } from "emoji-blast";

emojiBlast(); // Just one blast, please.
emojiBlasts(); // Commence blasting!
```

If you're using ESM or any modern JavaScript bundler or framework, such as ESBuild, Vite, or Webpack, this should _just work_.

See [emoji-blast API](./api) for more details.

## Quick HTML Start

If you're directly writing an `.html` document, you can plop this ðŸ‘‡ at the end of your `<body>`:

```html
<script async src="https://unpkg.com/emoji-blast/dist/now.js"></script>
```

That ðŸ‘† loads `emoji-blast` soon after your page loads and starts `emojiBlasts()` as soon as it can.

ðŸ‘Œ.

You'll probably want a little more fine-grained control over when the blasts occur.
Use this ðŸ‘‡ alternate script to create global `emojiBlast` and `emojiBlasts` functions:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/emoji-blast/dist/global.js"></script>
<script>
	emojiBlast(); // Just one blast, please.
	emojiBlasts(); // Commence blasting!
</script>
```
