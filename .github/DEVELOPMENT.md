# Development

After [forking the repo from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/emoji-blast
cd emoji-blast
pnpm install
```

> This repository includes a list of suggested VS Code extensions.
> It's a good idea to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and accept its suggestion to install them, as they'll help with development.

## Building

Run tsup locally to build source files from `src/` into output files in `lib/`:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Add `--watch` to run the builder in a watch mode that continuously cleans and recreates `lib/` as you save files:

```shell
pnpm build --watch
```

### Building Demos

A set of `.html` files exists under `demo/` with a different way of showing off `emoji-blast` features.
Each corresponds to a Webpack ["entry point"](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points) under under the same name.

Run [**webpack**](https://webpack.js.org) locally to build source files from `src/` into output files in `dist/`:

```shell
pnpm build:dist
```

Add `--watch` to run the builder in a watch mode:

```shell
pnpm build:dist --watch
```

## Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format code.
It should be applied automatically when you save files in VS Code or make a Git commit.

To manually reformat all files, you can run:

```shell
pnpm format --write
```

## Linting

This package includes several forms of linting to enforce consistent code quality and styling.
Each should be shown in VS Code, and can be run manually on the command-line:

- `pnpm lint` ([ESLint](https://eslint.org) with [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io)): Lints JavaScript and TypeScript source files
- `pnpm lint:knip` ([knip](https://github.com/webpro/knip)): Detects unused files, dependencies, and code exports
- `pnpm lint:md` ([Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)): Checks Markdown source files
- `pnpm lint:packages` ([pnpm dedupe --check](https://pnpm.io/cli/dedupe)): Checks for unnecessarily duplicated packages in the `pnpm-lock.yml` file
- `pnpm lint:spelling` ([cspell](https://cspell.org)): Spell checks across all source files

## Testing

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev) is used for tests.
You can run it locally on the command-line:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

Add the `--coverage` flat to compute test coverage and place reports in the `coverage/` directory:

```shell
pnpm run test --coverage
```

### Debugging Tests

This repository includes a [VS Code launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for debugging unit tests.
To launch it, open a test file, then run _Debug Current Test File_ from the VS Code Debug panel (or press F5).

## Type Checking

Run [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) locally to type check files in `src/`:

```shell
pnpm tsc --watch
```

You should also see suggestions from TypeScript in your editor.
